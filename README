ModelSim-List version 0.04
==========================

This is the README file for the ModelSim::List module.

This module provides a class named ModelSim::List with which the EDA tester
can easily check in the signals contained in the files generated by ModelSim's
"write list" command in a programming manner.

Here are tow examples of the list file format supported by this module:

         ns       /ram/mfc              
          delta       /ram/bus_data
          0  +2          1 xxxxxxxx
          0  +3          0 zzzzzzzz
         10  +0          1 0000aaaa
         10  +1          0 0000abcd 
         29  +0          1 0000abcd 
         38  +0          0 0000abcd 
         38  +2          0 zzzzzzzz 
         86  +0          1 zzzzzzzz 
         86  +1          1 0000abcd 

and if you use the -event option in the "write list" command, the list file will like follows:

    @0 +0
    /ram/mfc x
    /ram/mfc 0
    /ram/bus_data zzzzzzzz
    /ram/bus_data zzzzzzzz
    @10 +0
    /ram/bus_data 0000abcd
    @29 +0
    /ram/mfc 1
    @38 +0
    /ram/mfc 0
    @38 +2
